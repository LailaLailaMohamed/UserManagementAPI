**Project Overview:**

1. **Data Storage Approach:**

   In a real-life scenario, I would typically utilize a relational database such as MSSQL Server to store user data securely.

2. **Password Security:**

   In a real-life scenario, I would implement robust password hashing and encryption mechanisms to comply with industry best practices and security standards.

4. **Exception Handling Middleware:**.

 In a real-life scenario, I would implement a more comprehensive exception handling strategy tailored to specific application requirements, potentially leveraging frameworks or services for enhanced error management and reporting.

5. **Logging:**

In a real-life scenario, I would implement structured logging using a dedicated logging framework (e.g., Serilog, NLog) to facilitate centralized log management, detailed diagnostic information, and integration with monitoring tools.

Email Service Integration:

In a real-life scenario, I would integrate a third-party email service like SendGrid to handle email notifications. Email templates for various application scenarios (e.g., user registration, password reset) would be managed within the email service provider for consistency and ease of maintenance.
same will be done with SMS service to send mobile notifications.



**APIs Developed:**

- **Create User API:** Endpoint designed to create a user with `UserEmail` and `UserPassword`.

- **Find User by Email API:** Endpoint to retrieve a user by their email address from the mock repository.

- **Find User by Password API:** Endpoint to retrieve a user by their password (illustrative purpose only; not recommended for real scenarios due to security risks).

**Enhancement Proposal:**

- **Combined Search API:** Proposed a consolidated `findUser` API that accepts optional parameters (`email` and `password`) to search for users based on either criterion (`UserEmail` or `UserPassword`). This demonstrates flexibility and efficiency in API design within the simulated environment.

**Example of Combined Search API (Proposal):**

```
[HttpGet("findUser")]
public ActionResult<User> FindUser([FromQuery] string email = null, [FromQuery] string password = null)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(email) && string.IsNullOrEmpty(password))
    {
        return BadRequest("Either email or password must be provided.");
    }

    User user = null;
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(email))
    {
        user = _userService.GetUserByEmail(email);
    }
    else if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(password))
    {
        user = _userService.GetUserByPassword(password);
    }

    if (user == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    return Ok(user);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Combined Endpoint:** `findUser` API allows optional parameters (`email` and `password`) to locate users based on either `UserEmail` or `UserPassword`.

- **Controller Logic:** Decides which service method (`GetUserByEmail` or `GetUserByPassword`) to invoke based on the provided input, ensuring efficient user retrieval within the mock repository setup.

- **Flexibility:** Offers adaptability for clients to find users using diverse criteria without requiring distinct endpoints for individual scenarios, illustrating streamlined API usability in the simulated environment.

**Key Considerations:**

**Clean Code Principles:**

The code adheres to clean code principles such as readability, maintainability, and simplicity.
Naming conventions, code structure, and documentation were meticulously followed to enhance code clarity and comprehension.
**Service Architecture:**

The architecture employs a service-oriented approach to encapsulate business logic and facilitate loose coupling between components.
Services are designed to perform specific tasks related to user management, ensuring a cohesive and manageable application structure.
**Separation of Concerns:**

While the current project integrates domain and application layers, in a real-life scenario, these layers would be modularized into separate projects.
This separation ensures that each component focuses on a specific aspect of the application, minimizing dependencies and facilitating independent development and testing.

**Potential Project Structure:**

In a production environment, the solution would contains separate projects for domains (e.g., UserManagement.Domain) and applications (e.g., UserManagement.API), adhering to best practices for software architecture.
Each project would have defined responsibilities, promoting maintainability, scalability.
