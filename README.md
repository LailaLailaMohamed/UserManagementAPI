**Project Overview:**

1. **Data Storage Approach:**

   In a real-life scenario, I would typically utilize a relational database such as MSSQL Server to store user data securely.

2. **Password Security:**

   In a real-life scenario, I would implement robust password hashing and encryption mechanisms to comply with industry best practices and security standards.

4. **Exception Handling Middleware:**.

 In a real-life scenario, I would implement a more comprehensive exception handling strategy tailored to specific application requirements, potentially leveraging frameworks or services for enhanced error management and reporting.

5. **Logging:**

In a real-life scenario, I would implement structured logging using a dedicated logging framework (e.g., Serilog, NLog) to facilitate centralized log management, detailed diagnostic information, and integration with monitoring tools.

**APIs Developed:**

- **Create User API:** Endpoint designed to create a user with `UserEmail` and `UserPassword`.

- **Find User by Email API:** Endpoint to retrieve a user by their email address from the mock repository.

- **Find User by Password API:** Endpoint to retrieve a user by their password (illustrative purpose only; not recommended for real scenarios due to security risks).

**Enhancement Proposal:**

- **Combined Search API:** Proposed a consolidated `findUser` API that accepts optional parameters (`email` and `password`) to search for users based on either criterion (`UserEmail` or `UserPassword`). This demonstrates flexibility and efficiency in API design within the simulated environment.

**Example of Combined Search API (Proposal):**


[HttpGet("findUser")]
public ActionResult<User> FindUser([FromQuery] string email = null, [FromQuery] string password = null)
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(email) && string.IsNullOrEmpty(password))
    {
        return BadRequest("Either email or password must be provided.");
    }

    User user = null;
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(email))
    {
        user = _userService.GetUserByEmail(email);
    }
    else if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(password))
    {
        user = _userService.GetUserByPassword(password);
    }

    if (user == null)
    {
        return NotFound();
    }

    return Ok(user);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Combined Endpoint:** `findUser` API allows optional parameters (`email` and `password`) to locate users based on either `UserEmail` or `UserPassword`.

- **Controller Logic:** Decides which service method (`GetUserByEmail` or `GetUserByPassword`) to invoke based on the provided input, ensuring efficient user retrieval within the mock repository setup.

- **Flexibility:** Offers adaptability for clients to find users using diverse criteria without requiring distinct endpoints for individual scenarios, illustrating streamlined API usability in the simulated environment.
